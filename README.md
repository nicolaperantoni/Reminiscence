### About the Project

The project objective is to create a tool (it can be a tablet application) for motivating conversations and bonding with the elderly around sharing of their life stories. To do so, the tool should be able to trigger memory and aid on the storytelling process, making of it a bonding opportunity.

### Multimedia Content
