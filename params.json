This practice of reminiscence has been noticed to increase life satisfaction, lower or prevent depression and assist with cognitive orientation (Webster 2010). To  a lesser extent, it has also been seen to improve social interactions (Pinquart 2012) in elderly. In this project, we have chosen the practice of Reminiscence as a medium for enabling social interactions between elderly and their friends and our goal is to design and implement a tool to assist reminiscing interaction when elders meet their friends (e.g. in a community center) or their families (e.g. when they come to visit).\r\n\r\n### Project Objectives\r\n\r\nThe project objective is to create a tool (it can be a tablet application) for motivating conversations and bonding with the elderly around sharing of their life stories. To do so, the tool should be able to trigger memory and aid on the storytelling process, making of it a bonding opportunity. Specifically, the tool should:\r\n\r\n+ Life story sharing: allow elderly to write/record and share their life stories in an easy and fun way, ideally when they are together with family or friends.\r\n+ Life story exploration: explore what was happening around in the world when their stories took place (show pictures, events, songs, and everything that could trigger a person to talk about those times).\r\n+ Life story navigation: navigate through the stories using a timeline that it is easy to use.\r\n+ Life stories digitalization: in old times, digital cameras didnâ€™t exist, so most of their life stories will have a printed photography or a physical souvenir attached. If the tool can help them easily upload a digital version of this would be a great plus.\r\n\r\n### Multimedia Content\r\n\r\nWe've got a bunch of videos filmed by us that show the current state of our project and how it works, check'em out!\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt>First Sprint Video</dt>\r\n  <dd>https://vimeo.com/62800001</dd>\r\n  <dt>Second Sprint Video</dt>\r\n  <dd>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOmBns9EdeI</dd>\r\n  <dt>Final Presentation Video</dt>\r\n  <dd>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsnmFGJ-_WU</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n### Account to test our Application\r\n\r\n+ E-Mail:     g.forna [at] gmail.com\r\n+ Password:   test","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
